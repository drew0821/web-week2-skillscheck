            <p class="text">Writing an effective beginning to an essay is important if you<br>
             want to hook in a reader and get them interested in what you <br>
             are going to say. However, it is often difficult to come up with<br>
              this opening paragraph which is really going to make the reader<br>
               want to hear what you have to say. This is why sometimes many<br>
                students would want to seek out some form of assistance with their<br>
                 writing so that they may get better grades for their essays and <br>
                 papers. For that reason, you could employ our paragraph generator<br>
                  if found any.</p><style>
